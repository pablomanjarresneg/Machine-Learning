# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains multiple machine learning projects with standardized project structures. Each project follows best practices for organizing ML code, making them easier to understand, maintain, and scale.

## Projects

- **exoplanet-transit-detection**: Detection of exoplanet transits using time series data from Kepler/TESS missions.
- **stellar-classification**: Classification of stars based on their spectral and photometric properties.
